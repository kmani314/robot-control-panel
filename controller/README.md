# Controller

This is the physical controller body. The main housing contains the board and a cutout for the screen. It has 90 degree rotational symmetry about its center so that the screen can be oriented both portrait and landscape. 

The arms of the controller are meant to be swapped out. These have RC controller joysticks and some slots for buttons on the back.
